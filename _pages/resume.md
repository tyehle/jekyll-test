Projects
--------

#### Parsing with Derivatives: Senior Thesis
Extended the derivative parsing algorithm to English.

**Goal:** Caching parser for increased performance on large datasets.

**Method:** The derivative parser is left to right, producing a savable state after parsing each token. This state can then be loaded from a cache if a matching sentence prefix is seen in the future.

**Results:** The parser produced the correct parse trees, but benchmarking against existing parsers proved difficult.


#### Spatial Structure of Crime
Research Experience for Undergrads project at Florida Institute of Technology.

**Goal:** Use complex networks on police data to uncover structure in the timing and location of crimes.

**Method:** We built networks with links between spacial or temporally close crimes, and used network clustering algorithms to find interesting regions.

**Results:** Two publications, a [primary paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-15168-7_14) and a [follow up](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16112-9_22) from the same group based on this work.


#### Clustering of Suicide Cases
Project with the Department of Psychiatry at U of U.

**Goal:** Find familial groups in suicide cases. Find demographic or diagnostic attributes related to suicide. Possibly find genetic attributes related to suicide.

**Method:** I used network clustering algorithms to find familial groups of suicide cases.

**Results:** Some diagnostic abnormalities found. Research group is using the clusters for further analysis.


#### Python Compiler
Project for the compilers class written in Racket.

**Spec:** Lex and parse all of Python 3. Implement two desugaring passes, eliminating most syntactic constructs.

**Methods:** The resulting syntax tree was ready for one more desugaring pass before code generation in the assembly language.


#### Other Projects
- Sherlock (question answering system)
