I recently graduated from the University of Utah with my bachelors in Computer Science. My areas of interest are machine learning, natural language processing, and programming languages.

When I was there I worked with [Dr. Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com) in natural language processing, and played principal trumpet with the [Utah Philharmonia](http://music.utah.edu/ensembles/orchestras/philharmonia.php).

My other interests include climbing, hiking, biking, skiing and [pottery](pottery).
