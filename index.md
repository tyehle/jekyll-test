{% include image.html img="portrait.jpg" %}


I am currently a student at the University of Utah working towards my bachelors in Computer Science. My areas of interest are machine learning, natural language processing, and programming languages.

I am currently doing research with [Dr. Vivek Srikumar](http://svivek.com) in natural language processing. At school I also play trumpet in the performing ensembles, and take classes from the astronomy department.

When I'm not in school I enjoy climbing, hiking, biking, and games.
