{% include image.html img="resources/portrait.jpg" %}

I work at 3M HIS as a data plumber in the data science lab.

I enjoy functional programming, compilers, distributed systems, machine learning, hardware, and control theory.

I also sometimes play trumpet, climb, hike, bike, ski, and make [pottery](pottery).
