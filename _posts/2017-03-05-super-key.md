title: Super Key on Dell XPS Developer Edition
---

The windows/super key on my new laptop was disabled by the manufacturer.

This removes the default behavior of left maximize and right maximize and the search function.

Dell has to include a package to disable the super key called `dell-super-key` because of licensing for a button that has the windows logo on it.

I removed this package with

```bash
sudo apt remove dell-super-key
```

and then enabled its default behavior with the [compiz config manager](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/compizconfig-settings-manager/).

- Desktop → Ubuntu Unity Plugin → Launcher → Key to show the Dash ⇒ `<Super>`
- Window management → Grid → Bindings → Left/Right Maximize ⇒ `<Control><Super>Left/Right`

And now my laptop works as it should. Why Dell doesn't just print a different logo on that key is beyond me.
